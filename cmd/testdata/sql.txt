Test files for the SQL subcommand.

 - files prefixed with "fs: " will be written to a tempdir;
   they will be stripped out of test/want pairs (but preserved
   in tempdir)
 - a test/want pair consists of a test file (interpreted as
   a JSON array of strings) and a want file

The want files can have any number of blank lines at the
bottom, as they should be normalized; the convention is two
blank lines to denote the end of a test.


-- fs: input1.csv --
ID, Name
 1, Foo
 2, Food


-- regexp --
["-q=SELECT * FROM input1 WHERE Name REGEXP '^Foo$'", "input1.csv"]

-- want --
ID, Name
 1, Foo
